# Pokemon API Project

A small project using the pokemon API to display data about a particular pokemon.

It calls on an existing Pokemon API to retrive the data, then it is displayed in the corresponding data segments on the card.

## How to use the API search

Please type in a pokemon name into the search bar segment to retrive data from the API about that pokemon. For example if you type in "pickachu" it should retrive data about the pickachu's Type, Hp, Attack and Defense stats.
